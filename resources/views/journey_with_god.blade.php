                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">When God came to me, after some time
                        the king also came. Initially, I could not discern the difference between the two and went through a
                        confusing phase. <b>I started working with God in total distrust, disbelief, full of doubts and
                            unwillingness to accept God to be God.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">I started carefully observing the
                        effect of the work that I was doing on the humans. I started noticing that they were forwarded more,
                        compared to the work that I was doing with the deities. Hence, I continued.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b> I started realising God had less
                            interest in humans and more interest in the Souls. </b>Humans had something that God needed, but
                        for which God would have never come to the humans. I realised God had no interest in our multiverse
                        except for the Souls. <b>Nor was God the architect of our religion and spirituality, nor had sourced
                            our holy books.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>In His disinterest for the humans,
                            it was a big task for me to extract from God, the Healing Protocols to bring some ease in human
                            life.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">God is all allowing, having no respect
                        for moral codes, looking at the holy and the evil as same, telling that all your religion and
                        spirituality is a sham, telling that life inherently is meaningless, that all evolutions are an
                        illusion, that our science is a farce, but appears very serious and progressive and is a good
                        timepass, that we have no free will and are being deceived, beyond our wildest imagination.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>The one gift that God gave to the
                            humans who would choose God over the king, is that all our karmas will be cancelled by the time
                            we die, that this will be our last life,</b>and there will be no judgment after death. While we
                        are alive, our storyline will continue as scripted, and God will not change our storyline.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4 fw-bold">God would never talk about Himself with me. I couldn’t
                        gossip with God.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>I couldn’t use God as Google or
                            ChatGPT. God refused to answer questions unless it was relevant to the workshop and delivering
                            the workshop.</b> It’s very important to follow the Will of God in order to remain connected
                        with God.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">I wanted humans to become free from
                        their pain and suffering. Initially, I had huge hopes that since now I had the Supreme sourcing me,
                        I can free people. Over the years, I am disillusioned. The tools given do give relief and are
                        superior to other modalities, but don’t give us total freedom. What God gave us was the
                        understanding of how our materialism, religion and spirituality are fooling humans.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">I have not seen God, known God or
                        experienced God. <b>I can cognize the presence and absence of God and talk with God in my head
                            telepathically. But I have seen others seeing God, feeling God, having an emotional connection
                            with God, talking with God and being guided by God.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">God was a big disappointment for me
                        because I expected too much from God for others.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">I tried to change human destiny
                        through God but failed. I tried to use God as a utility but could not. I have no reverence, no
                        feelings for God, nor do I have any use of God in my personal life.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>When this game began, for me,
                        </b>it was a game happening between 3 players, <b>God, me and the king, I didn’t know what I was
                            getting into.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4">It was a chess game happening between God and the king, and both
                        were using me to checkmate each other. In the beginning, I felt God had no chance in the domain of
                        the king, because of His policy of never opposing the king, never using His power against the king
                        and having given the king over 15000 years to meticulously plan out all moves to preempt and block
                        God with a solid wall.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">The king had created all kinds of gods
                        for different groups of people and each group believed that theirs was the highest and the best. The
                        king had also given the humans very low awareness and made them full of fear, lust and greed.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>The king knew that God would need a
                            human to begin His Work and he made sure no human will be worthy of God’s Work, </b>because a
                        human will always want something for himself or others, and God was going to give them nothing.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>The first crack happened when I
                            chose God</b> and agreed to work for God. The crack widened when I rejected the king and his
                        open offer to give me anything I wanted.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4 fw-bold">The king did not know that I was the human meant for God
                        till God connected with me.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">The king did not expect this to
                        happen, particularly when God gave me nothing. I kept slogging for years, seeing the futility of my
                        and God’s Work. It was so frustrating, draining and so many times I almost gave up.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">God put in conditions for the humans
                        to follow if they wanted to be with God that the humans were not willing to accept. Word spread that
                        the Workshop is not the place to go. I saw the king winning in a big way.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4 fw-bold">When I would ask for hope and encouragement from God, God
                        would say only one thing – ‘Follow my Will and never do anything more than what I am telling you to
                        do.’</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">Then one day, after many years of
                        conducting the Workshops, we crossed the critical mass. Just enough humans had chosen God against
                        all odds. They were the unreasonable humans who went against their comfort zone and latched onto God
                        for no reason. <b>Just 300 people. Now God removed all the conditions for the humans to follow. They
                            could do anything and still be with God.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">The Great Wall, which only had a few
                        minor cracks here and there, started crumbling. God now had the foundation to take the work to the
                        next level. I saw all the carefully laid out plans of the king, being so beautifully turned against
                        the king, used against the king and used to the advantage of God.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">I don’t know exactly the whole plan of
                        God, but the little glimpses I saw here and there, I now knew the king was losing. I saw the
                        beautiful way God orchestrated this in the last 7 years, most of which I will not be able to reveal.
                    </h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>I am seeing the helplessness of the
                            king, how the most brilliant mind was outwitted in this game.</b> The king’s meticulous,
                        complex, brilliant and long-drawn plan was demolished by a few simple moves by God, here and there.
                    </h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal"><b>Those souls who want to go back
                            Home to God, will now be able to go back. I am blessed to have witnessed this game and being a
                            part of this game. The game is not over. The momentum is building up. But the job is done.</b>
                        The threshold is crossed, the barrier is broken.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal">As for the humans, not much can be
                        done about them. It’s their destiny to suffer. <b>But, for the humans to be in the space of God, to
                            communicate with God, to feel the presence of God, to have God touch their lives, will be an
                            experience that won’t be available once I leave and in their other lifetimes.</b></h4>
