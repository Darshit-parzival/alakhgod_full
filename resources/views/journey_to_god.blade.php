                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4 fw-bold">By Pradip Mukherji</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">7 years back I had no business with
                        God, was not interested in any God, and did not have much respect for people who were obsessed with
                        God. For me, <b>they were moving in blind faith and called that devotion, service and knowledge.</b>
                    </h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">They relied on certain scriptures
                        about whose origin no one knew anything about. No one knew who wrote them, why did they write and
                        from where they got that information. Instead of examining the contents dispassionately and putting
                        them to the test in an objective way, the authority demanded that we should never doubt them, that
                        we should revere them, and we should blindly follow them.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">I saw the madness all around me, the
                        drama, the control, the manipulation, the dominance and how the humans were exploited in the name of
                        God. I <b> saw the rise of the biggest business, the multiple mega enterprises called religion, that
                            so skillfully kept on expanding using the concept of God </b>that the best multinationals were
                        no match for them and needed to learn from them.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">Neither did I have any respect for the
                        spiritual people, masters and gurus who had certain mystical experiences and then came into the
                        business of acquiring followers with their oratory skills, deep knowledge, compassion and magnetic
                        personalities.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4 fw-bold" style="text-align: justify;">I saw suffering all around me, in those who failed, those
                        who succeeded, those who had nothing, and those who had everything. I felt a deep conspiracy all
                        around me, but could never find out what that was.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">I saw the futility of all the
                        solutions given through religion and spirituality because I saw the suffering kept growing in this
                        world. I examined some of the solutions and found them complicated, long-drawn, time-consuming and
                        unproductive in freeing the human from their suffering.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">I was thoroughly disillusioned with
                        religion, spirituality and the God business. I was passing my time with healing modalities, learning
                        and teaching them. I found them to be more authentic and productive, than religion and spirituality,
                        in relieving human suffering, without bringing in any kind of dogma.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">Playing with them, my extra sensory
                        perceptions started growing, and I found I could communicate with the individuals of the unseen
                        world and go into past lives instantly to gather information about what happened then, because of
                        which I am suffering now.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">I was teaching other modalities, and I
                        wanted my own modality. <b> With that in mind, I said to the universe what I wanted. At some point,
                        </b> I started communicating with a being who gave me a modality, which I started teaching. One
                        women who was psychically evolved in my class <b> told me Shiva was in the class.</b> That confirmed
                        the information I already knew.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">Shiva kept upgrading the techniques
                        and started sourcing me. Later I was sourced by Krishna, Sai Baba, Mahavatar Babaji and others. I
                        could connect with anything and anyone and get information from them. And then, one day, no one was
                        communicating with me. I tried connecting with them but felt like I was connecting with a void. My
                        head, in which all my communications were happening, became silent.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;"><b>Days passed, and then, </b> sitting
                        alone one night, came a clear thought – It’s now time to work for me. I asked who are you? The
                        answer came – God. I asked which one. <b> The answer came – Supreme.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal'; text-align: justify;">Having read and known about the mind,
                        I knew about the hallucinations and delusions the mind can create. Having dealt with the inhabitants
                        of the non-physical world, from the lower to the higher, from the entities to the deities and to
                        Shiva, the highest deity, I knew that each one of them was capable of deceiving my mind anyway they
                        wanted. <b> Having worked and interacted with them, I also knew how they treated the humans and what
                            kind of experience showed up when they were around.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal'; text-align: justify;">Unlike other humans who bow down to
                        the ones whom they revere, I never felt like revering anyone, I was never in awe of anyone. I was
                        curious to explore them, to know them. I was never ambitious or goal-oriented, and neither I had any
                        unmet personal needs.</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="text-align: justify;"><b>I had no need for any favor from anyone, human or gods. It
                            wasn’t that my personal life was sorted, in fact, it was a mess, but I didn’t care.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">And so started the work of God guiding
                        me, and the work started taking shape. As the work progressed, the king of the universe contacted me
                        and tried all ways to ensure I did not work for God, because <b>I was exposing the king and the
                            deceptions and the hypnosis the king had cast on the humans through materialism, religion and
                            spirituality.</b></h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">However, the work evolved and
                        continued over seven years as a comprehensive message came forth from God. The message was delivered
                        to the humans through me, whom God calls as the Messenger of God (I have no desire to be that).</h4>

                    <h4 class="index-font text-left mb-4" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">You can experience the Grace of God
                        through God’s Mantra. Try it for 30 days and see some freedom in your pain & suffering; and ease &
                        peace in your daily living.</h4>
